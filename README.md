# sawtooth-cookiejar
Simple cookie jar Sawtooth application example

# Introduction
This is a minimal example of a Sawtooth 1.0 application,
with a transaction processor and corresponding client.
This example demonstrates a simple use case, where a baker bakes or eats cookies in a virtual cookie jar.

A baker can:
1. bake one or more cookies to add to the cookie jar
2. eat one or more cookies in the cookie jar
3. count the cookies in the cookie jar

All cookie jar transactions have the same 6 hex digit prefix, which is the first 6 hex characters of the SHA-512 hash of "cookiejar" (that is, "a4d219").
The cookie jar is identified by `mycookiejar` with a corresponding public/private keypair.
The cookie jar count is stored at an 70 hex digit address derived from:
* a 6-hex character prefix (the "cookiejar" Transaction Family namespace) and
* the first 64 hex characters of the SHA-512 hash of the "mycookiejar" public key in hex.

# Components
The cookie jar transaction family contains two parts, both written in Python 3:
1. The client application has two parts:
* `pyclient/cookiejar_client.py`
contains the client class which interfaces to the Sawtooth validator via the REST API
* `pyclient/cookiejar.py` is the Cookie Jar CLI app
The client container is built with files setup.py and Dockerfile.

2. The Transaction Processor, `pyprocessor/cookiejar_tp.py`

# Prerequisites
This example uses docker-compose and Docker containers. If you do not have these installed please follow the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/install/

**NOTE**

The preferred OS environment is Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS x64.
Although other Linux distributions which support Docker should work.

# Building containers
To build TP code for Python and run the cookiejar.py example:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
The `docker-compose.yaml` file creates a genesis block, which contain initial Sawtooth settings, generates Sawtooth and client keys, and starts the Validator, Settings TP, and REST API.

# Usage
In a separate shell from above, launch the client shell container:
```bash
sudo docker exec -it cookiejar-client bash
```
You can locate the correct Docker client container name, if desired, with
`sudo docker ps`.

In the client shell you just started above, run the cookiejar.py application.
Here are some sample commands:

```bash
cookiejar.py bake 100 # Add 100 cookies to the cookie jar
cookiejar.py eat 50 # Remove 50 cookies from the cookie jar
cookiejar.py count # Display the number of cookies in the cookie jar

```
